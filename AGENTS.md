# OmniShip — Agent Guidelines & Repository Context

## Project Overview

OmniShip is a plugin-driven DAG release orchestration engine built in Python. Its core philosophy is:
> **Prove that Check → Build → Ship works as three composable DAGs, with plugins and artifacts flowing between them.**

## Core Architectural Invariants

Agents working on this codebase must adhere to the following architectural invariants:

1. **Strict Stage Boundaries**:
   - Stages execute sequentially: `CHECK` → `BUILD` → `SHIP`.
   - Stage completion barrier: all terminal nodes in a stage must succeed before the next stage starts.
   - **No cross-stage DAG edges**: nodes in `BUILD` cannot depend on individual nodes in `CHECK`.
2. **Core vs. Plugins Separation**:
   - `src/omniship/core/` contains pure DAG, node, stage, artifact, and executor models. It must know nothing about specific external integrations.
   - All integrations must be implemented as operations adhering to the `Operation` protocol (`src/omniship/plugins/api.py`).
   - Generic built-ins (`core/command`, `core/noop`, `core/python`) remain under `operations/`.
   - Tool-specific first-party providers (including Python and GitHub) live under `plugins/` and use the exact same entry-point registration protocol (`omniship.plugins`) as external third-party plugins.
3. **Failure & Skipping Semantics**:
   - If a node fails, directly and transitively dependent downstream nodes are marked `SKIPPED` (`Dependency '<id>' failed`).
   - Unrelated branches continue executing concurrently.
   - The stage is marked failed, preventing subsequent stages from starting.
4. **First-Class Artifacts**:
   - Artifacts produced during `BUILD` are verified on disk, normalized as `Artifact` objects, stored in `ExecutionContext.artifacts` (`ArtifactSet`), and forwarded to `SHIP` operations.

  ```bash
  uv run omniship --help
  uv run omniship plan -c examples/multi-artifact/omniship.yaml
  uv run omniship check -c examples/multi-artifact/omniship.yaml
  uv run omniship build -c examples/multi-artifact/omniship.yaml

## Testing & Quality Guidelines

- When modifying or adding operations, core DAG logic, or config schemas, add matching tests under `tests/`:
  - `tests/core/`: Unit tests for graph validation, cycle detection, DAG executor, artifact flow.
  - `tests/config/`: Unit tests for config loading, validation, and invalid schemas.
  - `tests/plugins/`: Unit tests for registry, discovery, and templating.
  - `tests/integration/`: End-to-end CLI runs with CliRunner.
- Always run `uv run pytest` before completing tasks.
- Keep dependencies minimal; avoid bringing in unnecessary runtime dependencies.
